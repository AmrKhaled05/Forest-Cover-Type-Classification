# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Classification

Forest Cover Type Classification is a machine learning project focused on predicting the type of forest cover for a given land patch using various cartographic features. By leveraging advanced classification algorithms, this project supports efficient forest management and environmental monitoring through automated land cover identification.

## 📝 Project Description

This project applies supervised learning techniques to classify land areas into distinct forest cover types based on a dataset of spatial and environmental attributes. The workflow includes:

- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans, encodes, and prepares the feature-rich cartographic dataset for analysis.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes distributions, relationships, and key patterns in the data to uncover influential factors.
- 🤖 **Model Development:** Implements and compares several classification algorithms to accurately distinguish between forest cover types.
- 🧪 **Model Evaluation:** Measures the effectiveness and reliability of the models using standard evaluation metrics.
- 📈 **Result Visualization:** Displays performance metrics and feature importance using clear and informative plots.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python 3.x:** Main language for data handling and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for development, exploration, and documentation.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data processing, transformation, and numerical computations.
